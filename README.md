This is the final version of the Expenses App that uses the Room persistence library, Navigation Component and some other third party libraries. It was implemented inspired 
on the MVVM Architecture. With this mobile Application you can put together all your expenses, have an overview how much you consume monthly and classify the expenses by
category. You have also a dashboard with 2 diagrams to see how your consume have been developing the last months.
This application is still been developed, so what you see is not the end product.
